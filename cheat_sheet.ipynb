    "### ✅ DO:\n",
    "- Use `port=5001` (or any number above 5000) to avoid conflicts\n",
    "- Always indent your code properly (Python is picky about spaces!)\n",
    "- Name your routes with `/` at the start: `@app.route('/home')`\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ DON'T:\n",
    "- Don't use `debug=True` inside app.run() in Jupyter notebooks (it breaks things) use in app.py\n",
    "- Don't forget to import Flask at the top\n",
    "- Don't forget the `return` statement (or you'll get errors)\n"

    "## 🎯 How This Works\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Magic Explained:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **You create a function** in each route file (e.g., `Signup_routes(app)`)\n",
    "2. **The function takes `app` as a parameter** - this is your Flask application\n",
    "3. **Inside the function, you define routes** using `@app.route()`\n",
    "4. **In main file, you call the function** and pass your app: `Signup_routes(app)`\n",
    "5. **Flask registers all those routes** to your application!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visual Flow:\n",
    "```\n",
    "app.py creates Flask app\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Calls Signup_routes(app)\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "signup.py receives app and adds routes to it\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Calls Login_routes(app)\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "login.py receives app and adds routes to it\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "All routes are now registered! 🎉\n",
    "```\n",

    "## 💡 Naming Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ GOOD Names (Descriptive!)\n",
    "```\n",
    "routes/\n",
    "├── user_auth.py      # Login, logout, signup\n",
    "├── products.py       # Product listing, details\n",
    "├── cart.py           # Shopping cart operations\n",
    "├── admin.py          # Admin panel routes\n",
    "└── api.py            # API endpoints\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ BAD Names (Confusing!)\n",
    "```\n",
    "routes/\n",
    "├── routes1.py        # What's in here???\n",
    "├── stuff.py          # Too vague\n",
    "├── misc.py           # No clue what this does\n",
    "└── test.py           # Is this even used?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rule of thumb:** If someone reads the filename, they should know exactly what routes are inside!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 🚀 Benefits of This Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "**Easy to Find Things**\n",
    "\n",
    "Need to change login logic? → Open `routes/login.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "Need to add dashboard feature? → Open `routes/dashboards.py`\n"
